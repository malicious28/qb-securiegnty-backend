# 🎯 OAUTH CALLBACK ERROR - FIXED!

## **THE PROBLEM:**

From your Render logs:
```
prisma:error Error in PostgreSQL connection: Error { kind: Closed, cause: None }
```

And when you tried to login:
```
{"error":"An error occurred while processing your request"}
```

**Root Cause:** Passport was creating its own Prisma instance, which was getting closed or having connection issues, preventing user creation/lookup during OAuth.

---

## **✅ WHAT I FIXED:**

Changed `config/passport.js` to use the centralized Prisma singleton instead of creating a new instance:

**Before:**
```javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');
const prisma = new PrismaClient(); // ❌ Multiple instances
```

**After:**
```javascript
const { getPrismaClient } = require('../utils/prisma');
const prisma = getPrismaClient(); // ✅ Shared instance
```

This ensures:
- ✅ Only one Prisma connection
- ✅ Connection stays open
- ✅ Proper connection pooling
- ✅ No "connection closed" errors

---

## **⏱️ WAIT FOR DEPLOYMENT:**

Render is deploying now (2-3 minutes). After deployment:

### **Test Again:**

1. **Clear your browser cache/cookies** (important!)
2. Go to: `https://qb-securiegnty-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/google`
3. Click your Google account
4. **Should now redirect to your frontend with tokens!** ✅

---

## **📋 EXPECTED FLOW (After Fix):**

```
1. Click "Login with Google"
   ↓
2. Google login page appears ✅ (This already worked)
   ↓
3. Select your Google account ✅ (This already worked)
   ↓
4. Backend processes OAuth ✅ (This will now work!)
   - Finds/creates user in database
   - Generates JWT tokens
   ↓
5. Redirects to: https://qbsecuriegnty.com/social-login-success?token=XXX&refresh=YYY
   ↓
6. ✅ SUCCESS! User logged in!
```

---

## **🔍 HOW TO VERIFY FIX WORKED:**

After deployment completes, check Render logs for:

**SUCCESS indicators:**
```
✅ Database connected successfully
✅ Authentication (Hardened) routes loaded
🎉 Google OAuth callback hit
✅ User authenticated: yourema il@gmail.com
✅ Tokens generated for youremail@gmail.com
✅ Redirecting to: https://qbsecuriegnty.com/social-login-success
```

**NO MORE:**
```
❌ prisma:error Error in PostgreSQL connection: Error { kind: Closed }
```

---

## **⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS:**

After OAuth works, you still need to:

1. **Fix Google Console** - Remove wrong redirect URI
2. **Create Frontend Route** - `/social-login-success` page
3. **Fix Frontend API URL** - Use production backend URL

---

## **🚀 CURRENT STATUS:**

- ✅ Environment variables correct
- ✅ Backend deployed successfully
- ✅ OAuth initiation works (Google login appears)
- ✅ Database connection fixed (centralized Prisma)
- ⏳ Waiting for Render to deploy fix
- 🎯 OAuth callback should work after deployment

---

**Wait 2-3 minutes for Render to deploy, then test again. The database connection error is fixed!** 🚀
