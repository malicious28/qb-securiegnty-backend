# 🚀 MANUAL DEPLOY INSTRUCTIONS

## Your Environment Variables Are Perfect! ✅

All required variables are set in Render. The issue is just the build script that needs to redeploy.

## Steps to Trigger Manual Deploy:

1. **In your Render Dashboard** (where you are now)
2. Click on **"Manual Deploy"** in the left sidebar
3. Click the blue **"Deploy latest commit"** button
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
5. Check **"Logs"** tab to see deployment progress

## What to Look For in Logs:

**SUCCESS indicators:**
```
✅ Building...
✅ ==> Running 'npm run build'
✅ ==> npm ci --production
✅ added 45 packages in 15s
✅ ==> Running 'npm start'
✅ 🔐 Google OAuth Configuration:
   Client ID: Set ✅
   Client Secret: Set ✅
✅ ✅ Authentication (Hardened) routes loaded at /api/auth
✅ 🛡️ ULTRA-SECURE SERVER STARTED SUCCESSFULLY!
```

**NO MORE:**
```
❌ Error: Cannot find module 'express-session'
```

## After Deployment Completes:

Test the OAuth endpoint:
```bash
curl -I https://qb-securiegnty-backend.onrender.com/api/auth/google
```

Should return:
```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?...
```

## If It Works:

You'll see the endpoint redirect to Google! Then you need to:
1. ✅ Fix Google Console (remove wrong redirect URI)
2. ✅ Fix frontend (use production backend URL)
3. ✅ Test complete OAuth flow

**Your environment is configured correctly. Just need to redeploy with the fixed build script!** 🚀
