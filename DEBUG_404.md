# ðŸ”´ DIAGNOSIS: /api/auth/google Returns 404

## The Issue

The endpoint `/api/auth/google` is returning 404 on the deployed Render backend, even though:
- âœ… Backend is healthy
- âœ… Other auth routes work (`/api/auth/security-status`)
- âœ… Routes are configured correctly in code

## Most Likely Cause

**The `/google` route is hitting rate limiting and being blocked!**

Look at the response headers from your test:
```
"ratelimit-remaining": "92"
```

The `authLimiter` middleware is probably blocking the route before it even reaches the handler.

## Solution

Let me check and fix the auth limiter configuration to ensure it's not too restrictive in production.
