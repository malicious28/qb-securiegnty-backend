# 🔍 DIAGNOSIS CHECKLIST

## **What I Need From You:**

### **1. Latest Render Logs (CRITICAL)**

Go to Render → Logs tab and copy logs from the LAST 2 minutes.

Look for these around the time you clicked your email:
```
🔍 [xxxxx] GET /api/auth/google/callback
🎉 Google OAuth callback hit
OR
❌ Any error messages
```

### **2. Check Database Connection**

In the logs, look for:
```
✅ Database connected successfully
OR
❌ prisma:error Error in PostgreSQL connection
```

### **3. What Happens When You Click Email**

Does it:
- Show a loading spinner?
- Immediately show the error?
- Redirect first then error?

---

## **🔧 POSSIBLE ISSUES:**

### **Issue 1: Session Not Working**
The session might not be persisting between OAuth initiation and callback.

### **Issue 2: Prisma Still Not Connected**
Even with centralized instance, connection might be failing.

### **Issue 3: User Creation Failing**
Database might be rejecting the user creation (missing required fields, etc.)

---

## **💡 QUICK TEST:**

Let's test if the database is actually accessible. 

Can you try accessing this URL in your browser:
```
https://qb-securiegnty-backend.onrender.com/health
```

And tell me what you see? It should show database status.

---

## **⚠️ IF LOGS SHOW DATABASE ERROR:**

We might need to run database migrations on Render. The `googleId` field might not exist in the actual database even though it's in the schema.

---

**Please share:**
1. Latest Render logs from the last 2 minutes
2. What `/health` endpoint shows
3. Exact moment the error appears (after clicking email)
