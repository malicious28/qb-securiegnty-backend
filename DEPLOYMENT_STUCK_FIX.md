# ðŸš¨ DEPLOYMENT STUCK - EMERGENCY FIX

## The Problem

Your Render deployment has been "Deploying" for over 1 hour. Normal deployments take 2-5 minutes.

This indicates:
1. Build is hanging/stuck
2. Prisma generation might be failing
3. Dependency installation issue
4. Render service issue

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

### Step 1: Cancel Current Deployment

1. In Render Dashboard, click on **"qb-securiegnty-backend"**
2. Look for **"Cancel Deploy"** or similar button
3. If no button, the deployment might have failed already

### Step 2: Check Logs

Click **"Logs"** tab and look for:
- Where did it get stuck?
- Any error messages?
- Last successful step?

### Step 3: Fix the Issue

The most likely issue is Prisma trying to generate during build, which might be failing.

## QUICK FIX - Update package.json

Remove `prisma generate` from postinstall since it might be causing issues on Render.

We'll generate Prisma client a different way.
