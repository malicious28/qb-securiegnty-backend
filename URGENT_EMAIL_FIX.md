# 🚨 **URGENT: EMAIL SYSTEM FIX REQUIRED**

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

From your Render logs, the issue is clear:

```
❌ Email service not configured
⚠️ EMAIL: Failed to send appointment confirmation to ashikamishra63@gmail.com: Email service not available
```

**Root Cause:** The `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable is **NOT SET** in your Render production environment.

## ✅ **SOLUTION: Add Environment Variables to Render**

### **Step 1: Access Render Dashboard**
1. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
2. Click on your `qb-securiegnty-backend` service
3. Go to **Environment** tab

### **Step 2: Add Missing Environment Variables**
Add these environment variables:

```env
RESEND_API_KEY=re_WoBtw9Rf_FbhW8XrPwJpY3X5et17xcGvi
SENDER_EMAIL=admin@qbsecuriegnty.com
```

### **Step 3: Deploy**
1. Click **Save Changes**
2. Render will automatically redeploy
3. Wait for deployment to complete

## 🔧 **ADDITIONAL ISSUES TO FIX**

From the logs, I also see these Prisma schema issues:

### **Issue 1: Unknown field `appointmentDate`**
```
Unknown argument `appointmentDate`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

### **Issue 2: Unknown field `isVerified`**
```
Unknown field `isVerified` for select statement on model `User`. Available options are marked with ?.
```

These need to be fixed in the code as well.

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **Priority 1: Environment Variables**
- Add `RESEND_API_KEY` to Render environment
- Add `SENDER_EMAIL` to Render environment

### **Priority 2: Fix Code Issues** 
- Fix `appointmentDate` field reference
- Fix `isVerified` field reference  

## 🎯 **Expected Result After Fix**

Once environment variables are added, you should see:
```
✅ Resend email service configured successfully
📧 Sending email to: ashikamishra63@gmail.com
✅ Email sent successfully: [email-id]
```

Instead of:
```
❌ Email service not configured
```

## ⚡ **QUICK FIX STEPS**

1. **Go to Render Dashboard NOW**
2. **Add environment variables**
3. **Save and redeploy**
4. **Test appointment booking again**

The email system code is perfect - it's just missing the API key in production! 🚀
